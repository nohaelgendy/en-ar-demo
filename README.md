# Multilingual Static Website Project

Welcome to the Multilingual Static Website Project! This repository showcases the implementation of a multilingual static website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project focuses on providing a seamless language-switching experience for users, catering to a global audience.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the website's structure and content.
- `assets/`:
  - `css/`: Contains the main stylesheet (`style.css`) and language-specific styles (`style-ar.css`, etc.).
  - `js/`: Holds the JavaScript files, including the main script (`script.js`) for language switching and content updates.
- `languages/`: Houses JSON files (`en.json`, `ar.json`, etc.) containing translations for different languages.
- `README.md`: You're reading it! This file provides an overview of the project and instructions for usage.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/nohaelgendy/en-ar-demo.git`
2. Open the project in a code editor of your choice.
3. Customize the HTML structure, styles, and content to match your website's theme.
4. Update the JSON files in the `languages/` directory with your own translations.
5. Experiment with the JavaScript code in `script.js` to enhance functionality as needed.

## Usage

To view your website locally, open `index.html` using the "live server" extension. You'll be able to switch between languages using the language options in the navigation bar.
